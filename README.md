![](images/img1.png)


- Analyzed a dataset for sentiment analysis.
- The SMILE Twitter dataset was used. Collection of emotion annotated tweets which speak about the British Museum. (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3187909.v2)
- Read the data in a PyTorch BERT model, and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification.
- Learned how to adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance.
- Learned about the architecture of BERT and Transformer.
- Learned about different tokenization methods such as Character Tokenization, Word Tokenization(Word2Vec,Glove) and Subword Tokenization(Byte Pair Encoding,WordPiece). 
- The end result was a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERTâ€™s large-scale language knowledge.
