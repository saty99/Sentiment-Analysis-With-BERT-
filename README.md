![](images/img1.jpg)


-The main purpose was to analyze a dataset for sentiment analysis.
-Read the in a PyTorch BERT model, and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification.
-Learned how to adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance.
-Learned about the architectecture of BERT and Transformer.
-Learned about different tokenization methods such as Character Tokenization, Word Tokenization(Word2Vec,Glove) and Subword Tokenization(Byte Pair Encoding,WordPiece). 
-The end result was a Sentiment Analysis model that leverages BERTâ€™s large-scale language knowledge.
